# DUNGEON OF DESPAIR

*Dungeon of Despair* (DoD) is a game inspired by the classic Macintosh shareware game *The Dungeon of Doom* and it's commercial release *The Dungeon Revealed*.

The goal of the game is very similar to *Rogue*: go to the bottom of a dungeon, find an item and return to the surface. The item at the bottom of the dungeon is guarded by an evil, powerful wizard.

While this game is inspired by *The Dungeon of Doom*, the aim is not to create a 100% carbon copy. There will be many similarities, but also plenty of differences. Most importantly, this version will be more modern, with some animations, more tile variations, etcetera.

## TURN-BASED SYSTEM

The game advances a turn in 2 situations:

- every couple of seconds if the player has not made a move
- if the player made a move, immediately
