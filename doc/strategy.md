1. Introduction
---------------
The goal of the game is quite simple, you start at dungeon level 1 and have
to go to the level 40 to get the Orb of Carnos, then get back to level 1
and exit the dungeon, but, of course, that is easier said than done, you'll
need a lot of patience to finish this game and a few strategies to make it
back in one piece!

For more information on the game, see:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Revealed



2. General notes
----------------
Here is what we can see in the status window at the right:
DL is for Dungeon Level,
HP is for Hit points
EL is for Experience Level
FD is for Food
There's also the HP bar and FD bar, all your attributes and a map that will
be created as you move.

Below the status window, is the message window which is quite useful for
understanding the effect that an item has on you.

When using a potion, a scroll or a wand, you will be able to identify it the
next time you will pick up another one, but you won't know the value of the
modifier.

Never try to use an item that has a negative modifier attached to it.

Don't use the same name for your player, it will screw up your Hall of
Legends.

The list of items below is complete, but some items with some modifiers are
missing, officialy, that is all the items I found and identified.

Since this game dates back from the 80's, it might be hard to be able to
play it today, but with "Mini vMac" on a Windows computer, it's works just
fine since it emulates a Macintosh 6.0.8, I found that with Basilisk, using
a Macintosh 7.5.5 it's not perfect, there won't be any sound.



3. Tips
-------
When starting a new game, make sure to wear your armor and wield your weapon
as soon as you start since they're not used by default.

This game is all about saving, this is extremely important! Save often! Like
before using an item because if it's produce a bad result, reload your game
and don't use it. Or when you have an Identify Scroll, save, use it on an item
and reload your game, you'll now know what the items do and what modifiers it
is and you'll still have your Identify Scroll.

Scrolls or Potions that gives statistics bonus always have a +1 or +2 effects,
save your game before using them and then use them until they gives you +2.

At the Dungeon Level 9, when trying to exit, a Gate Keeper will appear, after
getting rid of him, he'll give you a Wishing scroll. So, before you kill him,
save your game then kill the Gate Keeper, and use an Identify scroll on the
Wishing scroll, do this until it gives you a Wishing scroll +3 and save your
game. Use the Wishing Scroll and after every time it works save your game.
Wish for a Plate armor +4, a Regeneration ring +2 and an X-ray ring +2.

The wishing scroll will always give what you ask and the item will never be
curse, no need to identify the items.

Here's the list of items you should seek or not :
 Armor : Do not pick up armor on the floor, you'll have the Plate armor +4 at
         level 9 but if you find a glove, elven cloak or an helmet, pick them
         up and use them.
 Rings : Don't grab them up, you'll have the bests at level 9.
 Weapons : You need 2 weapons of any kind but note that you must have 16 of
           STR and 18 of DEX to be able to use them both at the same time.
           You'll see in the message window when you can hit 2 times in a row.
 Wands : Grab them all to survive until level 9, then they're useless.
 Digging wand : Grab as much as you can so you can make shortcuts through
                walls to either get to the exit faster or discover the secret
                areas.
 Death wand : Grab them all and use them on the Gatekeeper.
 Polymorph wand : Grab them all and use them on Vampires.
 Speed potion : Grab them all and use them on the Gatekeeper and the
                Dark Wizard.
 Life potion : Grab as much as you can to help you counteracts Vampire damage.
 Magic Mapping Scroll : Grab only one, you can re-use it as often as
                        you like if you save just before using it.
 Food : You only need 3 of them at all times, leave the rest near an exit.

Secret areas : In some deep dungeons, you can find a 3x3 or 4x4 closed area
filled with items, you need to use a digging wand on a wall and push the
boulder to be able to reach it. There can be many good things in it.

When you reach the Dungeon Level 40, the first thing to do is to reach the
center, there'll be a 3x3 area filled with boulders, one of the Orb of Carnos
is at the center, you don't need a Digging wand to reach the center, just push
the boulders diagonally. Then use an Identify scroll on the orb, if it shows
"A plastic ball", then it's not the right orb, you'll have to search for the
Plate armor +4 on the same level, the real orb will be under it.

Since you'll have to go to level 40 and back, you can leave some items near
the start or exit square, thus allowing you to carry more items and you'll be
able to pick them up when you come back. For example, gems and diamonds.

The monster Gate Keeper will appear when you try exiting these levels:
4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 29, 34, 39. You will have to kill it to continue. Each
time he is more powerful.

Use the spacebar to pass the time, useful to wait without moving to
regenerate HP.

Even with a maximum Strength of 25, there is a maximum of 50 items that you
can carry at the same time.

A simple trick to kill the Dark Wizard easily, is to attack him near a start
or exit square, if you're badly damage, change your Dungeon Level and wait so
you can regenerate your HP, go back the other level, attack him and so on.

Just before exiting the Dungeon Level 1 with the Orb of Carnos, make sure
your Inventory is completely full, this will give you a higher score for the
loot in the Hall of Legends.



4. Classes and attributes
-------------------------
Class      Str Int Wis Dex Con Cha Total Stats  Skills
Knight     16  10  10  16  18  15  85           Guessing armors
Fighter    18  8   8   16  15  9   74           Guessing weapons
Sage       14  22  8   14  13  15  86           Guessing scrolls
Wizard     14  8   22  14  13  15  86           Guessing wands
Alchemist  14  13  13  15  22  12  89           Guessing potions
Jeweller   14  13  12  22  12  13  86           Guessing rings
Jones      15  14  14  14  15  18  90           None

There's a maximum of 25 for each attributes, same for the Experience Level.

Strength helps to carry more items and deal more damages.
You also need at least 18 to push boulders.

Intelligence helps to use a scroll without it failing,
also at 16 you'll be able to auto-map (Very useful).

Wisdom probably helps to hit monsters with wands.

Dexterity probably helps being able to hit monsters and/or avoiding
being hit by a wand.

Constitution probably helps to have more Hit Points when
gaining an Experience Level.

Charisma probably helps to avoid monsters, they'll just pass
near you without seeing you.

My personal favorite would be the Fighter because he has the most Strength
and he only needs 1 Dexterity potion so he can use 2 weapons at the same time.
But the Knight ain't bad either because he has better stats everywhere else
and he doesn't start with a two-handed weapon.



5. Armors
---------
Best armor is the Plate armor.

If you are using a shield, you cannot use a two-handed weapon at the same
time.

The Elven Cloak can be worn with another armor but it must be worn after the
armor.

Banded armor -1 to +4
Chain armor -2 to +2
Elven Cloak -3 to +4
Gloves +0 to +2
Helmet +0 to +2
Leather armor -3 to +2
Plate armor -3 to +4
Shield -2 to +2



6. Weapons
----------
I found that the throwables are quite annoying to use all the time, plus the
fact that they don't seem to work a lot and they don't seem to cause a lot
of damage and they consume valuable spaces in the inventory. I never use them.

Dagger -2 to +2
Dart +7 to +10
Death Blade +2 to +4
Death Whip -2 to +4
Large rock +5 to +11
Long sword -2 to +4
Mace -3 to +4
Macintosh II +1: Throwable, very rare and very destructive
Sling -2 to +3
Spear +4 to +22
Small rock +39 to +41
Two-handed sword -3 to +4
